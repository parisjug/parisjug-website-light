Manik Surtani is a core R&D engineer at JBoss, a division of Red Hat. He
is the founder of the Infinispan project, which he currently leads. He
is also the spec lead of JSR 347 (Data Grids for the Java Platform), and
represents Red Hat on the Expert Group of JSR 107 (Temporary caching for
Java).

His interests lie in cloud and distributed computing, autonomous systems
and highly available computing. He has a background in artificial
intelligence and neural networks, a field he left behind when he moved
from academic circles to the commercial world. Since then, he's been
working with Java-related technologies, first for a startup focusing on
knowledge management and information exchange, and later for a large
London-based consultancy as a tech lead focused on e-commerce
applications on large Java EE and peer-to-peer technology.

Manik is a strong proponent of open source development methodologies,
ethos, and collaborative processes, and has been involved in open source
since his first forays into computing.

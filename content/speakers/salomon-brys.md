Passionate about Kotlin for the last three years, I am the developer and
maintainer of the Kodein library. Deeply rooted in the Open-Source
philosophy, I am dedicated to making tools and libraries to make
programming easier, safer, and more exciting. I also love boardgaming
and flying small planes (which I have a license for).

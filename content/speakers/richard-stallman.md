Dr. Richard Stallman launched the free software movement in 1983 and
started the development of the GNU operating system (see www.gnu.org) in
1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and
redistribute it, with or without changes. The GNU/Linux system,
basically the GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of
millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper
Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the the Takeda Award for Social/Economic
Betterment, as well as several honorary doctorates.

Simon is a Technical Evangelist at ZeroTurnaround, but is less about
preaching and more about discussion and interaction. His passion is
around technical communities and is the founder of the vJUG (new online
JUG) as well as an active member of the London Java Community (LJC)
organising group and the LJC JCP EC committee. Prior to joining
ZeroTurnaround, Simon was a developer and technical evangelist for IBM
on the WebSphere Application Server for over 10 years. He enjoys playing
and watching football (spherical variety), drinking tea and spending
quality time with his family.

Lucky founder and architect at Connect2id, which in 2014 released a  
clean slate implementation of an enterprise IdP server based on the
new  
OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 stack. Maintains a popular Java library for  
handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and an SDK for building OAuth 2.0 /  
OpenID Connect clients and servers. Shredding vicious trails with the  
mountain bike when away from the office and computers.
